# erb README
大多数基础内容由Erb插件的作者Riey完成，我在其插件的基础上进行了重构。

Most of the basic content is completed by riey, the author of Erb plugin.
I worked based on that plugin.

## Features
为emuera游戏所需的ERB文件提供代码高亮和代码补全

Provide snippets and syntaxes for Erb files required for emuera games

>注意：这个插件仅用于“EMUERA”游戏引擎所需的ERB文件，我并不会Ruby，如果你需要其他功能，请寻找别的插件。

>Note: this plugin is only used for Erb files required by the "emuera" game engine. I don't know and don't use Ruby. If you need more functions, please look for other plugins.
## Notice
众所周知一般编写ERB时不加标点，请使用右键来保证自动生成的snippets代码换到下一行，我在每行snippets后面都加了制表符/t来保证换行成功，不要直接回车。

 Erb is usually written without punctuation. Please use the right arrow key to ensure that the automatically generated snippets code changes to the next line. I added \t after each end line of snippets to help change line. Don't press enter directly.
